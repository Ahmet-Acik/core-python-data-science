# OOP Practice and Patterns in Python

This folder contains comprehensive, step-by-step practice and advanced examples for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It is designed for learners and professionals who want to master OOP concepts, patterns, and best practices with real-world code.

## Contents

- **oop_practice.py**  
  Core OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, dunder methods, class/static methods, abstract base classes, dataclasses, and a real-world employee system.

- **oop_patterns.py**  
  Advanced OOP topics and grouped patterns:
  - Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory)
  - SOLID Principles
  - Mixins & Multiple Inheritance
  - Composition vs Inheritance
  - Property Decorators
  - Custom Exceptions
  - Protocols (Typing)
  - Unit Testing (with asserts)
  - Serialization (pickle, JSON)
  - Metaclasses
  - OOP in Data Science (custom transformer)

## How to Use

- Run each `.py` file directly to see demonstrations and outputs for every concept.
- Use the code as a reference or template for your own OOP projects.
- Each section is self-contained and can be adapted for exercises or interviews.

## Recommended Next Steps

- Try extending the examples with your own classes and patterns.
- Add more design patterns (Observer, Strategy, Decorator, etc.).
- Write unit tests for your custom classes.
- Explore OOP in the context of data science, web development, or automation.
